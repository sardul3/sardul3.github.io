This is my portfolio site that attempts to reflect on me and the projects I have completed. For this, bootstrap is used to layout the 
grid and CSS to make it look better. Apart from that, hover effects are powered by JavaScript. Also, I have used media queries so that
the webpage adapts to mobile devices and various screen sizes.
